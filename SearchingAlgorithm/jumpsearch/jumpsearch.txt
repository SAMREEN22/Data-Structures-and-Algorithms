•Jump Search is a searching algorithm for sorted arrays.
•The basic idea is to check fewer elements by jumping ahead by fixed steps or skipping some elements in place of searching all elements.
•The time complexity of Jump Search is between Linear Search ((O(n)) and Binary Search (O(Log n)).
•Jump search has an advantage over binary search because we traverse back only once.
•Binary Search is better than Jump Search but in a system where binary search is costly, we use Jump Search.
