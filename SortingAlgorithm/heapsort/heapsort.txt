•A heap is a complete binary tree, and the binary tree is a tree in which the node can have the utmost two children.
•Heapsort is a popular and efficient sorting algorithm.
•The concept is to eliminate the elements one by one from the heap part of the list, and then insert them into the sorted part of the list.
•Time complexity of heap sort is O(n logn) in all three cases (best case, average case, and worst case).
