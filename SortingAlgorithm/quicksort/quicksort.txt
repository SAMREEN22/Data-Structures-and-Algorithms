•Quick sort algorithm follows the divide and conquer approach.
•Divide and conquer is a technique of breaking down the algorithms into subproblems, then solving the subproblems and combining the results back together to solve the original problem.
•Divide: Pick a pivot element.
               Partition the array into two sub-arrays such that each element in the left sub-array is less than or equal to the chosen element and each element in the right sub-array is larger than the chosen element.
•Conquer: Sort both the subarrays with Quicksort.
•Combine: Combine the sorted arrays.
